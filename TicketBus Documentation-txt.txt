Abstract

The Public Transport Management System is intended to make the process of travelling as easy and simplistic as possible. This system aims to make the present system paperless and more digitised. It facilitates ticket booking and bus pass applications online to eliminate time wastage. Existing Public Transport systems fail to provide sufficient information to users that are unfamiliar with the system. The System will overcome such issues by providing detailed information on how to travel in the bus and the time taken from one place to another. Users will be notified of the bus's arrival before the estimated arrival time and whenever a bus route is unavailable due to construction or blocked roads. System will provide a map that contains detailed information on bus routes, stops, and directions. Buses will be tracked from start to end to enable the user to view the route progress.


     Chapter 2: Introduction of Project


2.1 Introduction of Problem
2.1.1 Problem Statement

Existing Bus Transportation Systems are very inconvenient to both travellers and management due to the lack of an integral organizational system. Bus Passengers are unable to receive necessary information regarding their trip and struggle to reach their destination on time. Additionally, passengers find it very strenuous to book tickets as the process can be very time- consuming and informationally inadequate. In current transportation systems, numerous loopholes may exist that enable users to travel for free or at a very low cost due to a lack of a ticket verification system leading to a loss of money. Commuters are unaware of their bus route from source to destination stop leading to an ample of confusion and waste of time in searching for vital information. The travellers are unable to track the real-time location and they're unaware of how far their destination is. Furthermore, travellers are unaware of the estimated arrival time of the bus which may lead to the user missing their bus. In traditional systems, the process of applying for and delivery of a bus pass is very arduous as the whole process is physical and immensely time-consuming and the estimated time to apply for and receive a Bus Pass is 3-5 months depending on the circumstances.



2.1.2 Scope of Proposed System


In the scope of this project, we propose a system that will be used to manage Public Transport efficiently and is aimed at providing a solution for a haphazard existing transportation system. Our system will often be utilised by the general public to make their daily travels as effortless as possible. The proposed system is intended for the regular commuters and to reduce confusion among passengers. Students and Employees will find the process of booking tickets and travelling from their house to their intended destination very easy.

2.2.1 Technology Used

> The world is upgrading at a very rapid speed. To match that need we have used the following technologies to develop our system.

What is Android?


• Android is a mobile operating system developed by Google, based on a modified version of the, Linux kernel and other open-source software.
• Android's default user interface is mainly based on direct manipulation.
• Android is an open-source project and is distributed free of cost.
• This application makes user's life more comfortable and advanced.
• The operating system has a number of native applications supporting telephony, messaging, emailing, contact management, calendar, location services, mapping, social interaction, etc.
• Hardwires that support android are mainly based on ARM architecture platform.


Why Android?


• Android is an open-source project and is distributed free of cost. It is used and preferred by a larger audience.
• Android's User Interface (UI) is flexible and customizable. It is easy to operate and
comes with simple user interface.
• The operating system has a number of native applications supporting telephony, messaging, emailing, contact management, calendar, entertainment, multimedia experience, location services, mapping, social interaction etc.
• Third party java developers can use the Android API to extend the functionality of the devices.
• You can easily get your own app in the android market and you don't need to pay big
development fees.


Android Studio:








* Android studio is the official integrated development environment (IDE) for Google's Android operating System, built on JetBrains's IntelliJ Idea softwareand designed specifically for Android Development. It is available fordownload on windows, MacOS and Linux based operating systems. It is a replacement for the Eclipse android development tools (ADT) as primary IDE for native Android application development.
* In programming, Android studio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). It contains a base workspace and an extensible plug-in system for customizing the environment.
* Written mostly in JAVA, Android Studio can be used to develop applications. By means of various plug-ins, Android Studio may also be used to develop an application in other programming language: C++, JavaScript, Kotlin.


Java:





* Android is very popular OS for mobile phones today. Millions of apps are there that power different types, models and manufactures mobile phones today. Java the popular programming language is used to develop Androidapplications. The question is quite generic why java is used for android development, here in this article you will get the answer.
* The main objective behind Android development was to create a platform- independent application environment that can run on every device. As we know java already have this quality so java was chosen for android development. Android applications run on a special virtual machine called the Dalvik VM that is a direct inspiration from java virtual machine called JVM. Android application can run on any device where special Dalvik VM is implemented. These way android applications are compiled and run-in optimum performance environment with the feature of platform independence.
* The good approach towards software development is the object-oriented approach. Java is based on the oops concept. Android relies heavily on Java fundamentals like classes and objects and its other useful features of oops.
* Java has an extensive set of libraries. It is easy to take advantage of these libraries. Android SDK has many standard Java libraries included. These provide functionalities for data structure, math functions, graphics implantation, and networking functions and much more. These java libraries help us to do everything else we could want. This way java helps develop Android applications fast and inefficient manner.


* Android is made to run on different platforms i.e., hardware platforms. Thus, architectural neutrality is desired and necessary. Android code is written once and to execute need to compile and optimize native code for betterperformance on various devices. Java has platform independent feature so it is used for android development.


Firebase:




* Firebase is a platform developed by Google for creating mobile and web applications.
* It was originally an independent company founded in 2011.
* In 2014, Google acquired the platform and it is now their flagship offering for app development.
* Firebase frees developers to focus crafting fantastic user experiences. You don't need to manage servers. You don't need to write APIs. Firebase is your server, your API and your datastore, all written so generically that you can modify it to suit most needs.

Firebase offers a number of services, including:

* Analytics - Google Analytics for Firebase offers free, unlimited reporting on as many as 500 separates events. Analytics presents data about user behaviour in iOS and Android apps, enabling better decision-making about improving performance and app marketing.
* Authentication - Firebase Authentication makes it easy for developers to build secure       authentication       systems       and       enhances        the        sign-in and onboarding experience for users. This feature offers a complete identity


solution, supporting email and password accounts, phone auth, as well as Google, Facebook, GitHub, Twitter login and more.
* Cloud messaging - Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) is a cross-platform messaging tool that lets companies reliably receive and deliver messages on iOS, Android and the web at no cost.
* Realtime database - the Firebase Realtime Database is a cloud-hosted NoSQL database that enables data to be stored and synced between users in real time. The data is synced across all clients in real time and is still available when an app goes offline.
* Crashlytics - Firebase Crashlytics is a real-time crash reporter that helps developers track, prioritize and fix stability issues that reduce the quality of their apps. With crashlytics, developers spend less time organizing and troubleshooting crashes and more time building features for their apps.
* Performance - Firebase Performance Monitoring service gives developers insight into the performance characteristics of their iOS and Android apps to help them determine where and when the performance of their apps can be improved.

Data Gathering

- The process of gathering and analyzing accurate data from various sources to find answers to research problems, trends and probabilities, etc., to evaluate possible outcomes is known as Data Gathering.
- In this, we have gathered the data from various agencies running public transport systems, passengers who use public transport on their daily basis, government employees working in public transport sectors and students who uses public transport on their way to educational institutions, we approached them and asked what the current transport system lacks and what facilities they'd like that can potentially make them use public transportation more often, after gathering all this data, we have planned this type of workflow.
- We have gathered data that will be required to fulfil the requirements of the proposed system.


- Our System has 3 users:

1. Passenger
2. Driver
3. Admin

- Passenger Workflow

* Firstly, the passenger needs to register to the Application using their phone number and email address and authenticate using a generated OTP (One Time Password).
* The user can now start up the application and operate it. They will be able to go through all the different functions and features that may be useful to them.
* Passenger will be able to plan their entire trip or check nearby stops with the distance relative to said stop, the next bus to arrive at that stop and its respective time.
* The passenger would be able to enter source and destination stops and can generate a travel route.
* Passengers can book tickets and also go through past transactions, notifications and are also able to update their profile


- Driver Workflow


* Driver can go through the systems dashboard and can use many functionalities.
* The driver first has to login to the system and can view the driving route.
* He can also update the bus's status if any problem occurs with that
particular bus.
* The driver can also select a cause of the problem from the specified list and the system would notify the passengers accordingly about their bus status.
* The driver can also request for a backup bus in case of occurrence of any problems/issues.


- Administrator Workflow


* The admin can manage the entire system.
* Firstly, the admin has to login to the system and then he can broadcast notifications to all passengers, manage buses, routes, and drivers.
* The admin would update the status of the bus, stops or routes and notify the passengers accordingly regarding guidelines from the system or from the municipal corporation.
* Admin would also notify the passenger/user about the status of their bus pass application.
